        "- Collaborative Problem Solving: The collaboration among the user proxy agent and the assistant agents fosters a cooperative problem-solving environment. The agents can share information and knowledge, allowing them to complement each other's abilities and collectively arrive at better solutions. On the other hand, the Safeguard acts as a virtual adversarial checker, which can perform another safety check pass on the generated code.\n",

        "- Memory Management: The UnbiasedCathode agent's role in maintaining memory related to user interactions is crucial. The memory retention allows the agents to have context about a user's prior questions, making the decision-making process more informed and context-aware.\n",
