{"scenario":"PV generation increased by 20%","status":"optimal","objective":7.42,"baseline":8.06,"interpretation":"In this scenario, increasing solar power generation by 20% means that more energy is being produced from the sun, which can help meet the energy needs of the household or facility. As a result, the total energy costs decreased by EUR 0.64, or about 7.9%, compared to the baseline, indicating that using more solar energy is saving money. The optimization results show that the system is operating efficiently, balancing solar generation with energy demand, and reducing reliance on more expensive energy sources."}
{"scenario":"import capacity increased by 10%","status":"optimal","objective":9.26,"baseline":8.06,"interpretation":"When import capacity increases by 10%, the system has more flexibility to import energy from the grid when needed. However, this scenario results in higher total costs of EUR 9.26, which is 14.8% higher than the baseline scenario. This suggests that while increased import capacity provides more options, it leads to higher energy expenses, likely because the system is importing more expensive grid energy instead of relying on cheaper local generation or stored energy."}
{"scenario":"25% of load shifted from hour 13 to hour 14","status":"optimal","objective":8.06,"baseline":8.06,"interpretation":"Shifting 25% of the energy load from hour 13 to hour 14 demonstrates how load shifting can help balance energy demand throughout the day. In this case, the total cost remains approximately the same at EUR 8.06, showing only a minor impact on overall expenses. This suggests that the timing shift did not significantly affect the optimization outcome, as the system was able to efficiently manage the load redistribution without major cost implications."}
