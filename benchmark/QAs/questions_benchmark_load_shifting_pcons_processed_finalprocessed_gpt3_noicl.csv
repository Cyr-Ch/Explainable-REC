What would happen if prosumer 2 shifts 65% of their load at timestep 2 to timestep 2+1,Pcons[1][1] = Pcons[1][1]*(100-65)/100 \nPcons[1+1][1] = Pcons[1+1][1] + Pcons[1][1]* 65/100,-27.211111111111116,"# Calculate the new load shifted from timestep 2 to timestep 2+1 for prosumer 2
shifted_load = 0.65 * Pcons[1, 1]

# Update the load at timestep 2 and timestep 2+1 for prosumer 2
Pcons[1, 1] -= shifted_load  # Subtract the shifted load from timestep 2
Pcons[2, 1] += shifted_load  # Add the shifted load to timestep 2+1",,Sorry. I cannot answer your question.
